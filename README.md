# Cardiological Examinations Graph
This repository contains the final project of the **Big Data Analytics and Business Intelligence** course at *University of Naples Federico II*.

A dataset containing medical information of different patients is provided. Patient's information includes its examinations, with the relative anamnesis and diagnosis, written in Italian.
The aim of the project is to build a **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** system capable of extracting diseases and symptoms from textual inputs. Labeled data are provided to train the model.
Once the NER system is developed, a **graph-based database** must be developed, integrating the patients information (examinations, diseases, symptoms, etc.).
